# Strive-x-Sammi

A Bridge Extension for [SAMMI](https://sammi.solutions). Take interactions in game and turn them into stream gimmicks!

## Extension Function

This extension allows you to receive data from TheLettuceClub's [GGST x SAMMI Live Content Mod](https://github.com/TheLettuceClub/StriveSAMMI-Release) in the form of a button that fills with data at 60Hz, and Extension Triggers for individual, one-off events. It's currently separated into these two mechanisms for performance reasons. The data stream to the button may become an Extension Trigger of it's own at a later date.

## Quick Start Guide

Step 1: Download [SAMMI](https://sammi.solutions).

Step 2: Follow the various [SAMMI Onboarding Tutorials](https://sammi.solutions/docs/getting-started/step-by-step).

Step 3: Install Guilty Gear Xrd x SAMMI as a [SAMMI Bridge](https://sammi.solutions/docs/bridge) Extension.

Step 4: Boot up Guilty Gear Strive while SAMMI and SAMMI Bridge are open to automatically connect.

Step 5: Access the Strive_Data button for gamestate info, and make use of the various Extension Triggers generated by Strive to drive stream gimmicks!
