# Guilty Gear -Strive- x SAMMI

## Using the Mod

### Important Notes

#### Run Bridge in a regular browser instead of the embedded OBS dock for better performance.

Apparently, OBS can't handle our data. It's too much.

#### Run SAMMI at framerates >60FPS to stop button events from backing up. 

It's a SAMMI thing. This can affect commands like Motion, so if you need to animate things in OBS, I recommend the OBS Move plug-in.

### Accessing Events via Extension Triggers

The following Extension Triggers are available for use. Add them to buttons via a button's Trigger menu. They all contain extremely relevant data within that can be accessed via the `Trigger Pull Data` command.

| Extension Trigger | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ggst_stateUpdate`| Occurs once a frame. Contains all sorts of cool gamestate data. |
| `ggst_hitEvent` | Occurs on Hit or Block. Contains relevant data. |
| `ggst_roundStartEvent` | Triggers on Round Start. |
| `ggst_roundEndEvent` | Triggers on Round End. |

### Example of Detecting Really Big Counterhits.
This is in the Commands screen of a button set up with the `ggst_hitEvent` Extension Trigger. The ggst_hitEvent trigger sends along it's own data object that you access with `Trigger Pull Data`.
